// The menu function can be easier controlled with a incremental encoder (rotary switch).
// Both switches of the rotary switch can be connected with 1 kOhm resistors to PD2 and PD3.

// You must also connect both switch contacts with two 10 kOhm resistors to VCC (pull up).
// The best choise is a incremental encoder with Push Button. The button can be connected
// parallel to the start key of the Transistor Tester.

// If your encoder has the same count of pulses at any switch as indexed positions (detent) for every turn,
// you should set the WITH_ROTARY_SWITCH to 2 or 3.
// If your encoder has twice the count of indexed positions, you should set the WITH_ROTARY_COUNT to 1.
// For rotary encoder without indexed position or with an indexed position at every change of
// the state of any switches (four times the count of pulses) you can set the
